# Rot 13 Kata

## Introduction

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

## Explanation

- Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13.

- If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are.

- Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".

- Please note that using encode is considered cheating.
